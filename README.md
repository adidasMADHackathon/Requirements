## Machine learning

You have all the pip requirements in the requirements.txt file.

You have the entire environment in environment.yml file.

If you want you can use one or another. It is located in the [seed project](https://github.com/adidasMADHackathon/seed-keras-models)

### Must have

- [python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip3

### We recommend you

- [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) *If you are using windows powershell it might not work unless you run it with CMD*
- [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)

** Use anaconda or virtualenvwrapper

** We recommend you to use anaconda, but feel free to use whatever you want

#### Install dependencies

It is up to you to install it or not, or even use another method or technology.

```bash
# with virtualenvwrapper
$ mkvirtualenv -p python3 bot # create virtual environment
$ workon bot # enter VE
(bot) $ pip install -r requirements.txt # install dependencies (make sure you are in the bot VE)
(bot) $ deactivate # exit VE

# with anaconda
$ conda env create -f environment.yml # create virtual environment
$ conda activate bot # enter VE
(bot) $ conda deactivate # exit VE
```

** In the workshop you will be learning to work with Keras (running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano). You need TensorFlow to run as backend or CNTK, or Theano.

** Since the 1.7 version of Tensorflow includes Keras, we recommend you to install it

### Nice to have
